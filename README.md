## Known Issues

In the Iterated Local Search approach the perturbation is not strong enough. We get stuck in a local minimum too easily. The hill climbing method is also not working very well with this specific implementation.

## Notes

Values tested in the perturbation now work
500 iterations not enough in ILS. Using 10000 works.
